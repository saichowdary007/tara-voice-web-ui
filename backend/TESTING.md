# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Voice Agent to ensure its performance, functionality, and user acceptance.

## 8.1 Performance Testing

### Latency Testing
- **Objective:** Measure the end-to-end response time from user speech input to agent audio output (ear-to-ear latency).
- **Method:** An automated chronometer suite will be developed to capture timestamps at key processing stages:
    - Start of user utterance
    - End of user utterance
    - STT completion
    - LLM first token response
    - LLM full response completion
    - TTS audio generation completion
    - Start of audio playback
- **Success Criteria:** Average ear-to-ear latency should be below a predefined threshold (e.g., < 2 seconds) for a natural conversational experience.

### Load Testing
- **Objective:** Validate the system's scalability by simulating multiple concurrent users.
- **Method:** Use a load testing framework (e.g., Locust, JMeter) to generate simultaneous requests to the agent's API endpoints.
- **Success Criteria:** The system should maintain acceptable response times and a low error rate under the expected peak load of concurrent users.

### Stress Testing
- **Objective:** Identify the system's breaking points and behavior under extreme load.
- **Method:** Gradually increase the number of concurrent users and request rate beyond normal operational capacity until the system fails.
- **Success Criteria:** The system should degrade gracefully without catastrophic failure (e.g., data corruption). Recovery mechanisms should be tested.

### Endurance Testing
- **Objective:** Identify memory leaks, resource degradation, or performance drops over extended periods.
- **Method:** Run the system under a sustained, moderate load for long-running sessions (e.g., 24-48 hours).
- **Success Criteria:** System resource utilization (CPU, memory) and response times should remain stable throughout the test duration.

## 8.2 Functional Testing

### Language Detection
- **Objective:** Test the accuracy of the language detection module.
- **Method:** Use a pre-recorded dataset of audio clips containing:
    - Pure English
    - Pure Telugu
    - Code-switched English/Telugu phrases
- **Success Criteria:** Achieve >95% accuracy in correctly identifying the primary language of the utterance.

### Speech Recognition (STT)
- **Objective:** Validate the accuracy of the Speech-to-Text transcription for both supported languages.
- **Method:** Use a diverse test set of audio clips, including various accents, speaking rates, and background noises.
- **Success Criteria:** Word Error Rate (WER) should be below an acceptable threshold for both English and Telugu.

### Conversation Flow
- **Objective:** Test the agent's ability to handle multi-turn conversations and maintain context.
- **Method:** Design and execute scripted test cases that simulate realistic conversational flows, including:
    - Follow-up questions
    - Clarifications
    - Topic changes
- **Success Criteria:** The agent should correctly reference previous turns and provide contextually appropriate responses.

### Barge-In Handling
- **Objective:** Verify that the system can handle user interruptions (barge-in) smoothly.
- **Method:** While the agent is speaking, the user will begin talking.
- **Success Criteria:** The agent's audio output should stop immediately, and the system should start processing the new user input without loss of information.

## 8.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

### Native Speaker Testing
- **Objective:** Validate the naturalness, fluency, and cultural appropriateness of the agent's Telugu responses.
- **Method:** Recruit a panel of native Telugu speakers to engage in open-ended conversations with the agent.
- **Success Criteria:** Collect qualitative feedback via surveys and interviews. The feedback should be predominantly positive regarding the agent's language quality.

### Conversational Testing
- **Objective:** Assess the overall user experience in natural, unscripted dialogue scenarios.
- **Method:** Users will be given high-level tasks or topics and encouraged to interact with the agent as they would with a human.
- **Success Criteria:** High user satisfaction ratings and successful task completion rates.

### Edge Case Testing
- **Objective:** Test the system's robustness against unusual or challenging inputs.
- **Method:** Test cases will include:
    - Very short or empty user utterances
    - Loud background noise
    - Rapid or slow speech
    - Non-standard vocabulary or slang
- **Success Criteria:** The agent should handle these cases gracefully, either by asking for clarification or providing a helpful error message.

### Accessibility Testing
- **Objective:** Ensure the agent is usable by individuals with speech impediments.
- **Method:** Involve users with various speech disabilities in testing.
- **Success Criteria:** The agent should demonstrate a reasonable level of transcription accuracy and provide a functional experience for these users.
